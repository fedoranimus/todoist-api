# Authorization

In order to make authorized calls to Todoist APIs, your application must first
obtain an access token from the users. This section describes the different ways
of obtaining such a token.

For the sake of simplicity we decided to not list the token on every parameter
table but please note that the **token is required for every resource**.

Note that we encourage your application to use
the [OAuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth) protocol to obtain the access
token from the user, as the other authentication methods (`login` and
`login_with_google`) are scheduled for deprecation.

## OAuth

External applications could obtain a user authorized API token via the OAuth2
protocol. Before getting started, developers need to create their applications
in [App Management Console](/appconsole.html) and configure a valid OAuth
redirect URL. A registered Todoist application is assigned a unique `Client ID`
and `Client Secret` which are needed for the OAuth2 flow.

This procedure is comprised of 3 steps, which will be described below.

### Step 1: The authorization request

> An example of redirecting a user to the authorization URL:

```shell
$ curl "https://todoist.com/oauth/authorize" \
    -d "client_id=0123456789abcdef" \
    -d "scope=data:read,data:delete" \
    -d "state=secretstring"
```

Redirect users to the authorization URL at the endpoint
`https://todoist.com/oauth/authorize`, with the specified request parameters.

Here follow the required parameters:

Name | Description
---- | -----------
client_id *String* | The unique Client ID of the Todoist application that you registered.
scope *String* | A comma separated list of permissions that you would like the users to grant to your application. See below a table with more details about this.
state *String* | A unique and unguessable string. It is used to protect you against cross-site request forgery attacks.

Here are the scope parameters mentioned before:

Name | Description
---- | -----------
task:add | Grants permission to add tasks to the Inbox project (the application cannot read tasks data). This is only used by the helper method of [adding an item](#add-item).
data:read | Grants read-only access to application data, including tasks, projects, labels, and filters.
data:read_write | Grants read and write access to application data, including tasks, projects, labels, and filters. This scope includes `task:add` and `data:read` scopes.
data:delete | Grants permission to delete application data, including tasks, labels, and filters.
project:delete | Grants permission to delete projects.

And here are some common errors that you may encounter:

Error | Description
----- | -----------
User Rejected Authorization Request | When the user denies your authorization request, Todoist will redirect the user to the configured redirect URI with the `error` parameter: `http://example.com?error=access_denied`.
Redirect URI Not Configured | This JSON error will be returned to the requester (your user's browser) if redirect URI is not configured in the App Management Console.
Invalid Application Status | When your application exceeds the maximum token limit or when your application is being suspended due to abuse, Todoist will redirect the user to the configured redirect URI with the `error` parameter: `http://example.com?error=invalid_application_status`.
Invalid Scope | When the `scope` parameter is invalid, Todoist will redirect the user to the configured redirect URI with `error` parameter: `http://example.com?error=invalid_scope`.

### Step 2: The redirection to your application site

When the user grants your authorization request, the user will be redirected to
the redirect URL configured in your application setting. The redirect request
will come with two query parameters attached: `code` and `state`.

The `code` parameter contains the authorization code that you will use to
exchange for an access token. The `state` parameter should match the `state`
parameter that you supplied in the previous step.  If the `state` is unmatched,
your request has been compromised by other parties, and the process should be
aborted.

### Step 3: The token exchange

> An example of exchanging the token:

```shell
$ curl "https://todoist.com/oauth/access_token" \
    -d "client_id=0123456789abcdef" \
    -d "client_secret=secret" \
    -d "code=abcdef" \
    -d "redirect_uri=https://example.com"
```

> On success, Todoist returns HTTP 200 with token in JSON object format:

```json
{
  "access_token": "0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

Once you have the authorization `code`, you can exchange it for the access token
by doing a `POST` request to the following endpoint:

`https://todoist.com/oauth/access_token`.

Here follow the required parameters:

Name | Description
---- | -----------
client_id *String* | The unique Client ID of the Todoist application that you registered.
client_secret *String* | The unique Client Secret of the Todoist application that you registered.
code *String* | The unique string code that you obtained in the previous step.

And here are some common errors that you may encounter (all the error responses
will be in JSON format):

Error | Description
----- | -----------
Bad Authorization Code Error | Occurs when the `code` parameter does not match the code that is given in the redirect request: `{"error": "bad_authorization_code"}`
Incorrect Client Credentials Error | Occurs when the `client_id` or `client_secret` parameters are incorrect: `{"error": "incorrect_application_credentials"}`


## Revoke Access Tokens

Access tokens obtained via OAuth could be revoked making a JSON request (HTTP
POST) to the following endpoint:

`https://todoist.com/api/access_tokens/revoke`


```shell
curl -X POST https://todoist.com/api/access_tokens/revoke \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"client_id":"xyz", "client_secret":"xyz", "access_token":"xyz"}'
```

### Parameters:

Name | Required | Description
---- | -------- | -----------
client_id *String* | Yes | The unique Client ID of the Todoist application that you registered.
client_secret *String* | Yes | The unique Client Secret of the Todoist application that you registered.
access_token *String* | Yes | Access token obtained from the OAuth authentication

Upon successful request, a HTTP 204 response will be returned.


## Migrate Personal Tokens to OAuth Tokens

Tokens obtained via the old email/password authentication method could be
migrated to the new OAuth access token. Migrating your users' personal tokens
will allow users to see your app in their Todoist Settings page and give them
the ability to manage their app authorization.

Here is the migration API endpoint (HTTP POST, with JSON request parameters):

`https://todoist.com/api/access_tokens/migrate_personal_token`

```shell
curl -X POST https://todoist.com/api/access_tokens/migrate_personal_token \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"client_id":"xyz", "client_secret":"xyz", "personal_token":"xyz", "scope": "data:read"}'

{"access_token": "....", "token_type": "Bearer"}
```

### Parameters:

Name | Required | Description
---- | -------- | -----------
client_id *String* | Yes | The unique Client ID of the Todoist application that you registered.
client_secret *String* | Yes | The unique Client Secret of the Todoist application that you registered.
personal_token *String* | Yes | Token obtained from the email/password authentication
scope *String* | Yes | Scopes of the OAuth token. Please refer to the [OAuth](https://developer.todoist.com/#oauth) section for the detailed list of available scopes.

Upon succesful request, a HTTP 200 response will be returned with a new OAuth
token in JSON format:

`{"access_token": "....", "token_type": "Bearer"}`


## Cross Origin Resource Sharing

All API endpoints not related to the 3 OAuth steps support Cross Origin Resource
Sharing (CORS) for requests from any origin. The header
`Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` is set for successfully authenticated requests.

> CORS headers example:

```shell
$ curl https://todoist.com/api/v7/sync \
    -d token=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567 \
    -H 'Origin: http://example.com'

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: false
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```


```python
>>> import requests
>>> requests.post('https://todoist.com/api/v7/sync', 
...               data={'token': '0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567'}, 
...               headers={'Origin': 'https://example.com'}).headers

{'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials': 'false', 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin': '*', <...>}
```
